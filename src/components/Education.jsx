            <h4> 1: why you should invest</h4>
Investing is an effective way to put your money to work and potentially build wealth.
Smart investing may allow your money to outpace inflation and increase in value.
Inflation can cut your purchasing power in half.
inflation has averaged about 3%, over 20 years, that's enough to give $100,000 the purchasing power of just $54,000
Stocks rose 1,100 times over the past 70 years
That's enough to turn a single, modest $1,000 investment into more than a million dollars.
You can slash your tax rate nearly in half by being a long-term investor.

<h4>2: what type of investor you are</h4>
It's important to recognize what type of investor you are. Are you willing to take high risk options, or would you prefer long term investments. Determining your risk level will help you evaluate your investing limits.

<h4>3: how much money you are able to invest</h4>
	Identify what you are willing to invest! You don't need a large amount of money to start investing, but it is important to determine what percentage of your income will go towards investing. Most financial planners advise saving between 10% and 15% of your annual income. 

<h4>4: choosing an investing account</h4>
	There are many types of investing accounts that you can choose:
1. Standard brokerage account: A standard brokerage account — sometimes called a taxable brokerage account or a non-retirement account — provides access to a broad range of investments, including stocks, mutual funds, bonds, exchange-traded funds and more.
2. Retirement accounts: A retirement account, such as an IRA, or individual retirement account, is a standard brokerage account with access to the same range of investments. The biggest difference between a retirement account and a brokerage account is how the IRS taxes — or doesn’t tax — contributions, investment gains and withdrawals.
3. Education accounts: One of the most popular types of accounts used to pay for education expenses is the 529 savings plan (this is different from 529 prepaid tuition plans that let you lock in the in-state public tuition at the institution that runs the plan). Most states offer their own 529 plans that you can open directly, but typically the money can be used at eligible schools nationwide.
4. Investment accounts for kids: Investing doesn't have to be just for adults! There’s custodial brokerage accounts and custodial IRAs that are managed by adults until the minor turns 18.


<h4>5: investing for long-term</h4>
Investments held for longer periods tend to exhibit lower volatility than those held for shorter periods. The longer you invest, the more likely you will be able to weather low market periods. 
Putting your money in long-term rather than short-term investments also provides tax advantages on capital gains.
Long-term gains (those held over 12 months) are taxed at rates below your income tax bracket. Short-term gains, on the other hand, are taxed as regular income.

<h4>6: managing your portfolio</h4>
Portfolio management involves building and overseeing a selection of investments that will meet your long-term financial goals.
Regularly reviewing your investments will ensure that you know whether they’re on track to meet your financial objectives. 
The level of risk you’re prepared to accept may change over time which will affect your asset allocation
